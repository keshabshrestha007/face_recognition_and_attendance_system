This file is used by Streamlit Cloud to install necessary system-level

dependencies that are not Python packages (i.e., .so files).

libgl1-mesa-glx and libgthread-2.0-0 provide the necessary OpenGL (libGL.so.1)

and GTK/GObject libraries required by the OpenCV dependency (cv2)

for proper initialization in a headless Linux environment.
